## 3. Data Foundation & Source Tables

To build these assets, the following source tables must be available in the data foundation layer:

| Source Table | Name / Description | System Source | Used by Asset(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `mara` | Operational source table. | `Common` | `materials` |
| `makt` | Operational source table. | `Common` | `materials` |
| `t023` | Operational source table. | `Common` | `material_groups` |
| `t023t` | Operational source table. | `Common` | `material_groups` |
| `t134` | Operational source table. | `Common` | `material_types` |
| `t134t` | Operational source table. | `Common` | `material_types` |
| `marc` | Operational source table. | `Common` | `material_plants` |
| `mard` | Operational source table. | `Common` | `materials_by_storage_location` |
| `t001l` | Operational source table. | `Common` | `materials_by_storage_location` |
| `t001w` | Operational source table. | `Common` | `materials_by_storage_location` |
| `mast` | Operational source table. | `Common` | `material_to_bom_link` |

## 4. Transformations & Design Decisions

This section details the critical engineering and design decisions behind the transformations.

### A. Granularity & Primary Keys

* **materials:** Client (`client_mandt`), Material Number (`material_number_matnr`), and Language Key (`language_key_spras`).
* **material_groups:** Client (`client_mandt`), Material Group Code (`material_group_matkl`), and Language Key (`language_key_spras`).
* **material_types:** Client (`client_mandt`), Material Type (`material_type_mtart`), and Language Key (`language_key_spras`).
* **material_plants:** Client (`client_mandt`), Material Number (`material_number_matnr`), and Plant (`plant_werks`).
* **materials_by_storage_location:** Client (`client_mandt`), Material Number (`material_number_matnr`), Language Key (`language_key_spras`), Plant (`plant_werks`), and Storage Location (`storage_location_lgort`).
* **material_to_bom_link:** Client (`client_mandt`), Material Number (`material_number_matnr`), Plant (`plant_werks`), BOM Usage (`bom_usage_stlan`), Bill of Material (`bill_of_material_stlnr`), and Alternative BOM (`alternative_bom_stlal`).

### B. Joins & Relationship Logic

* **materials:** `mara` is INNER JOINed to `makt` on `mandt` and `matnr` to bind material codes with their multilingual descriptions.
* **material_groups:** `t023` is INNER JOINed to `t023t` on `mandt` and `matkl` to map group codes to texts.
* **material_types:** `t134` is INNER JOINed to `t134t` on `mandt` and `mtart` to pair type keys with their textual definitions.
* **material_plants:** Direct projection from the foundational `marc` table without joins.
* **materials_by_storage_location:** `mard` is INNER JOINed to `makt` on `mandt` and `matnr` to bind multilingual material descriptions, LEFT JOINed to `t001w` on `mandt` and `werks` to bind plant names, and LEFT JOINed to `t001l` on `mandt`, `werks`, and `lgort` to enrich with storage location descriptions.
* **material_to_bom_link:** Direct projection from the foundational `mast` table without joins.
* *Note on text joins:* Joins to text tables may multiply entries if multiple language keys are configured, or omit items if translation lines are not fully populated.

### C. Incremental Load Strategy

*   **Supported Materialization Types:** `incremental` | `table` | `view`
*   **Incremental Logic:**
* **materials:** Uses the `GREATEST` recordstamp of `mara` and `makt` to capture updates in either the material attributes or descriptions.
* **material_groups:** Calculated from the `GREATEST` recordstamp values of `t023` and `t023t`.
* **material_types:** Determined by the `GREATEST` recordstamp of `t134` and `t134t`.
* **material_plants:** Determined by the `recordstamp` of `marc`.
* **materials_by_storage_location:** Calculated from the `GREATEST` recordstamp of `mard`, `makt`, `t001l`, and `t001w`.
* **material_to_bom_link:** Determined by the `recordstamp` of `mast`.

### D. ERP Source System Differences (ECC vs. S/4HANA)

* **materials:** No differences. Unified script is used across both ERP versions.
* **material_groups:** No differences. The table structures of `t023` and `t023t` are identical.
* **material_types:** No differences. `t134` and `t134t` structures are structure-compatible.
* **material_plants:** No differences. Unified script is used across both ERP versions.
* **materials_by_storage_location:** Catch Weight Management (CWM) columns are available in S/4HANA but omitted here to maintain a unified, standard schema across both ECC and S/4HANA versions.
* **material_to_bom_link:** No differences. Unified script is used across both ERP versions.
* Field Selections:**
* **materials:** Restricts columns to fields aligned with the legacy Cortex 6 `MaterialsMD.sql` reference views to assure structural continuity.
* **material_groups:** Aligns column selection with the fields extracted in the Cortex 6 reference view `MaterialGroupsMD.sql`.
* **material_types:** Selects the exact columns present in the Cortex 6 reference view `MaterialTypesMD.sql` for backward schema compatibility.

### E. Field Conversions & Calculations

*   **Currency & Conversions:** Standardized using built-in currency shift logic for currencies with non-standard decimal formats (e.g. JPY, IDR).
*   **Field Selections:** Enriched with operational data and standard language text mappings where applicable.
